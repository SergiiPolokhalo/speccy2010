# speccy2010
FPGA development board dedicated for the implementation of various gaming computers (primarily ZX Spectrum).

Harware Key Features:
---------------------

* FPGA: EP2C8Q208C8N
* Microcontroller: STR755FV2T6 (or STR750FV2T6)
* Memory: SDRAM 16 Mb K4S281632J-UC75 (or 32 Mb K4S561632J-UC75)
* RTC: DS1338Z-33 +
* Slot for SD card
* Two PS/2 ports (keyboard, mouse)
* 2 ports for joysticks
* USB - virtual com for debugging and programming the microcontroller
* Video: three R-2R matrixes, 8 bits each (output to VGA, Composite, S-Video)
* Audio TDA1543 or two R-2R matrixes, 8 bits each
* Power supply 5V, 1A.

Firmware for microcontroller is upgradeable via USB virtual com. Firmware for FPGA is loaded directly from the SD card. No special programming tools are needed.
